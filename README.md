# React-Native-App-Test
## Learning React on my Own

I chose to learn about React Native because I would like to be able to create mobile apps as well as desktop apps which in turn will make me more marketable to potential employers.

I was first made aware of React Native when my class was introduced to React and upon researching the upcoming lesson, I came across React Native.

React Native solves the problem of having to learn new languages to create mobile apps by using Javascript. 

Conceptually it allows you to see your updates in real time on your phone. 

One uses it to develop mobile apps.

A big alternative to React Native is PhoneGap, Flutter and NativeScript as well as TouchstoneJS. 

React Native is most similar to TouchstoneJS which is powered by React.

React Native was created as Facebook's internal hackathon project in 2013 and was actually released in 2015 at React.js Con. Created because cross platform apps just could not match the performance of native apps. It became so popular because it doesnâ€™t require learning native iOS and Android languages and is very user web-developer friendly.


Internal Facebook developers built it.

It is open soucre but maintained by Facebook.

After having  little bit of experience with React it seems, fairly easy. I still have yet to get into complex functions but as far as showing some weblinks and a pictureit was definitely on the easier side.


My biggest hurdles are understanding the correct syntax, and getting used to how things are called. 

The best resource I found was this React Native tutorial on youtube.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZnfsJ6mM5c

Github articles using expo to set it up was the most helpful.
